== Description ==

[ImageEngine’s Image CDN](https://imageengine.io/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine) plugin accelerates your WordPress or WooCommerce performance by optimizing images, converting them to WebP, JPEG2000, or AVIF, and delivering them through the ImageEngine content delivery network. The result is smaller image payload, faster page loading, improved Google PageSpeed Insights scores (Speed Index, Largest Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive), and a better user experience leading to more conversions or sales. To use this plugin with the ImageEngine Optimizer CDN, get a [free trial account here](https://control.imageengine.io/register?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine).


= How ImageEngine Works =

This plugin rewrites your image URLs to include the ImageEngine Delivery Address you recieve when you sign up for an ImageEngine account. This rewrite will allow ImageEngine to access your original images, instantly optimize and convert them, and deliver via the ImageEngine CDN. After configuring and enabling the plug in, image are delivered this way:

* When a visitor requests an image, ImageEngine CDN servers use client hints or device detection to identify the requesting devices and browser characteristics.
* Based on the browser characteristics, ImageEngine will resize, compress and convert images to WebP, JPEG 2000, or AVIF.
* The optimized image is delivered from the nearest ImageEngine CDN region. Subsequent requests are served instantly with WebP, JPEG 2000, or AVIF images and stored on ImageEngine's global CDN.

Other static content like fonts, CSS and JavaScript are also optimized by applying Brotli or gzip compression which dramatically reduces that size of heavy WordPress themes.

= What Makes ImageEngine Better Than Other CDNs or Digital Asset Management Platforms? =

* Delivers optimized WebP, JPEG 2000, or AVIF images 30% faster than other CDNs or Digital Asset Management platforms.
* Achieves up to 80% image payload reduction with no perceptible change in quality.
* Simple to install. Easy to test your configuration before enabling it. No need to move or upload images.
* Only CDN with true device-aware edge servers to drive superior, fine-tuned image optimization.
* Automatic image optimization of JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, BMP, TIFF into next-generation formats like WebP, JPEG 2000, AVIF, Animated WebP, or MP4. You can also safely serve non-image content like CSS, Javascript, Fonts and any other files through ImageEngine and they will be served using the cutting-edge Brotli compression, decreasing Total Blocking Time and Time to Interactive.
* Delivers via its scalable global CDN network, with support for HTTPS, HTTP/2, WAF, and DDoS protection.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is an Image CDN =

An [Image CDN](https://imageengine.io/what-is-an-image-cdn?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine) is just like a normal CDN, but with built in features to optimize images. With ImageEngine, this optimization happens automatically, according to the capabilities of the device or browser.

= What kinds of files can I serve through the CDN? =

You can serve any static files, for example, images, videos, audio files, css, javascript, documents, etc. Normally, all the files in the content directories (usually `wp-content` and `wp-includes`) are static and are safe to serve.  If you include other directories, be sure to exclude any files types that are not static.

= Can I use this plugin if my site is not yet on the public internet? =

If the CDN cannot contact your server over the internet, it will not be able to serve your content.  You can configure the plugin, but you should leave it disabled until your site is publicly accessible.  Some CDNs, like [ImageEngine](https://imageengine.io/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine) support fetching assets from behind password-protected sites and other origins like AWS S3.  These options may work for sites that are not publicly accessible.

= How do I obtain a free ImageEngine trial =

To get started with ImageEngine you need to [sign up for an account](https://control.imageengine.io/register?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine). Then you'll be provided with a unique CDN hostname to use with this plugin. The trial is free for 30 days, and can be cancelled anytime.
